# Building-Loop-maze-line-follower-Micomouse

Meshmerize is a line follower maze solving robot which we have made previously and it 
turned out sucessful. I am glad to say that we even won micromuse competition held at LOCUS 2024. Even though we used simple algorithm but it was quite challenging to implement on actual hardware and electronics.

## Problem

Algorithm used by the meshmerize is quite traditional(LSRB) algorithm which cannot solve maze containig inward loops, it might get stuck with in loop. It is also not gaurented that it will take shortest path. So sloving that problem will build another micromouse which can solve any type of maze and will take shortest path. This repo is espically for that. We will keep this repository regulary updated based on our research unitl we conclude making micromous as we desire.
